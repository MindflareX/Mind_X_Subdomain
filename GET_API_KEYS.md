3. **VirusTotal** (500/day): Plenty for multiple domains
4. **Shodan** (100/month): Use for interesting IPs you discover

## No API Keys?

The tool still works great without API keys! You'll still get:
- ‚úÖ Email infrastructure mining
- ‚úÖ Cloud bucket enumeration
- ‚úÖ Smart permutations
- ‚úÖ JavaScript endpoint extraction
- ‚úÖ Certificate transparency (crt.sh - no key needed)
- ‚úÖ Acquisition mapping

API keys just add **bonus data sources**.

## Questions?

- Keys not working? Check you copied them correctly (no extra spaces)
- Rate limited? The tool handles this automatically with delays
- Want to upgrade? Most services offer month-to-month paid plans
